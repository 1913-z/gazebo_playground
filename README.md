# GAZEBO SIMULATION WORLDS AND MODELS

Gazebo/PX4 simulation environment for autonomous flight in dynamic environment. The realsense D435 camera is assembled with the drone (IRIS model), and the thrust/weight ratio is of the drone is modified to 0.25 which is similar to our hardware platform. The realsense gazebo plugin is modified to be more lightweight to output high-frequency point cloud message in poor computers.
